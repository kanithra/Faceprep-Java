Area Calculation
Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in a square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively.  Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.
Input format:

First input: a side of a square in integer

Second input: length of a rectangle in integer

Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer

Fourth input: radius of a circle in float



Output format:

The first output should be the area of a square in integer

The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer

The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places

Solution:

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner obj=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=obj.nextInt();
        int b=obj.nextInt();
        int c=obj.nextInt();
        float d=obj.nextFloat();
        
        int x=a*a;
        int y=b*c;
        double z=3.14*(d*d);
        
        System.out.println(x+"\n"+y+"\n"+z);
        
    }
