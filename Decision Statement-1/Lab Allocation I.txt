Solution:

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        //fill the code;
        Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
        int x=s.nextInt();
        int y=s.nextInt();
        int z=s.nextInt();
        if(x<y&&x<z)
        System.out.println("L1");
        else if(y<x&&y<z)
        System.out.printf("L2");
        else
        System.out.println("L3");
    }
